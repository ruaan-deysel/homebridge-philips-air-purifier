# Verified layout: Homebridge runs in Docker container "homebridge"; its storage
# dir /var/lib/homebridge resolves to /homebridge in the container, which is the
# host directory /mnt/cache/appdata/homebridge.
#
# Plugins install into the LOCAL plugin dir /var/lib/homebridge/node_modules,
# NOT the global npm root. Only homebridge-config-ui-x lives in the global root
# (/opt/homebridge/lib/node_modules); every other plugin on this instance is
# local. Installing globally leaves the plugin invisible to Homebridge and the
# UI, with no error anywhere — verified the hard way.
